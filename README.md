# Some Cool Hex Game
Unity Version: 2019.1.12f1

## Description

This is intended to be a turn based strategy game. It is a bit different from others I've played, I'll explain how:

A turn consists of all players on in the game planning (giving orders) to all of their units. The units do not follow these orders yet, they are just planned. When everyone is ready, they hit 'end turn', whereupon the units begin executing their orders.

The orders can consist of moving, shooting, providing overwatch, digging in, etc.

Units can be suppressed by enemy fire (losing accuracy to their own attacks), they gain defense when staying in place and lose defense when moving.

Different tiles provide different positives and negatives like extra defense, or a boost or suppression to movement.

Different units have different types of attacks, for example riflemen attack a unit, as opposed to a tile, whereas mortar teams attack tiles as opposed to units. Rifle men have their attacks obstructed by cliffs and trees, where mortar teams can fire over them.

If anyone has any additional ideas, feel free to add them here, or add them as tasks to the Project.
